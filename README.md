Goal is to predict the human behaviour using the smartphone accelerometer 

# Human Activity Recogonition Using Smartphones - KNeighbors Classifier

In this project we will design a robust activity recogonition system based on the smartphones.
As we all know mobile devices have accelerometer as the sensor which collects the activities.
These activities can be classified using K-nearest neighbour. 

## Database Information

The data was collected from 30 subjects aged between 19 and 48 years old performing one of 6 standard activities while wearing a waist-mounted smartphone that recorded the movement data. Video was recorded of each subject performing the activities and the movement data was labeled manually from these videos.


### Attribute Information:

For each record in the dataset it is provided:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
- Its activity label.
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
